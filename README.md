## **An Open Science Initiative for Mapping Common Chemical Abbreviations**

Welcome to the **Beilstein Chemical Lookup Collection** â€“ an open, community-driven resource dedicated to collecting and standardizing **chemical abbreviations and shorthand notations** used in structure drawing, reaction schemes, and synthetic chemistry.

This open-science repository aims to gather, curate, and share a comprehensive set of chemical lookups. In chemical drawings or reaction schemes, it's common to use abbreviated labels to represents (larger) substructures:

| Abbreviation | Meaning             | SMILES/SMARTS | Notes                     |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `Ph`         | Phenyl              | `c1ccccc1`    | Benzene ring              |
| `Bn`         | Benzyl              | `c1ccccc1CH2` | Common protecting group   |
| `tBu`        | tert-Butyl          | `C(C)(C)C`    | Often used as steric bulk |
| `Boc`        | tert-Butoxycarbonyl | `OC(C)(C)C=O` | Amine protecting group    |
| `Et`         | Ethyl               | `CC`          | Alkyl chain               |

This project aims to **collect, normalize, curate and publish** these mappings as **open source** structured data and human readable.

## Goals

- Create comprehensive lists of chemical abbreviations used in:
  - Academic literature
  - Chemical drawing software
  - Reaction databases
- Provide **machine-readable formats** for use in parsers, renderers, and other cheminformatics tools
- Identify **ambiguities**, **overloads**, and **regional variations**
- Enable community contribution and review for open data curation

## What is in this repository
- `abbreviations.smi` â€“ a machine-readable dictionary for structural group abbreviations on chemical drawings
  - It is a two-column, tab separated text file, the first column contains the abbreviation and the second column holds the corresponding SMILES, using an asterisk (`*`) to indicate the attachment point
  - The initial abbreviations list contains the most common abbreviations found in the [Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry](https://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/home) articles. The abbreviations are translated and reviewed into structures and SMILES by our chemical experts.  
  
  | Abbreviation | SMILES        |
  | ------------ | ------------- |
  | `C`          | `*c1ccc(F)cc1`| 
  | `â€“OCH2Oâ€“`    | `*OCO*`       |
  | `MeO`        | `CO[*]`       |
